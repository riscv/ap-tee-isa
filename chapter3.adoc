== `Smsdid`: Supervisor Domain Identifier and Protection Register

`Smsdid` defines an interface to program the active supervisor domain
under which a hart is operating. The interface consists of M-mode CSRs `msdcfg`
and `mttp`. The SDID programmed via this interface is a local identifier for the
hart and may be used to tag hart-local resources to access-control data
associated with the supervisor domain.

The `mttp` register is an `XLEN`-bit read/write register, formatted as shown in
<<sdid-32>> for `XLEN=32` and <<sdid-64>> for `XLEN=64`, which controls
physical address protection for supervisor domains. This register holds the
physical page number (`PPN`) of the root page of the memory tracking table
(`MTT`), a supervisor domain identifier (`SDID`), which facilitates address
protection fences on a per-supervisor-domain basis; and the `MODE` field, which
selects the address protection scheme (MTT Mode to be enforced) for physical
addresses. The MTT is a structure that holds the access permissions for a
physical address and is looked up per the programmed `MODE`.

Attempts to read or write `mttp` while executing in U, S or HS-mode will raise
an illegal instruction exception.

<<mtt-32>> shows the encodings of the `MODE` field when `XLEN=32` and
<<mtt-64>> shows the encodings of the `MODE` field when `XLEN=64`. When `mttp`
`MODE=Bare`, supervisor physical addresses have no MTT-based protection across
supervisor domains beyond the physical memory protection scheme described in
Section 3.7 of the RISC-V privileged architecture specification cite:[ISA]. In
this case, the remaining fields (`SDID`, `PPN`) in `mttp` must be set to
zeros, else generate a fault. When `XLEN=32`, the other valid settings for
`MODE` are `Smmtt34` and `Smmtt34rw`, to support allow/disallow and read-write
access permissions for 34-bit system physical addresses.

When `XLEN=64`, other than `BARE`, the other valid settings for `MODE` are
`Smmtt[46, 56][rw]` to support read-write/access permissions for 46-bit and
56-bit system physical addresses.

The remaining `MODE` settings when `XLEN=64` are `reserved` for future use and
may define different interpretations of the other fields in `mttp`.

Implementations are not required to support all defined `MODE` settings when
`XLEN=64`. A write to `mttp` with an unsupported `MODE` value is not ignored.
Instead, the fields of `mttp` are `WARL` in the normal way, when so indicated.

The `PPN` refers to an `MTTL3` table or an `MTTL2` table based on physical
address width (`PAW`). For 56 \<= `PAW` < 46, `MTTL3` table must be of size
`2^(PAW-43)` bytes and naturally aligned to that sized byte boundary. For 46
\<= `PAW` < 32 the `MTTL2` table must be of size 2^(`PAW`-23) or 2^(`PAW`-22)
bytes (depending on the Smmtt `MODE` selected) and must be naturally aligned to
that sized byte boundary. In these modes, the lowest two bits of the physical
page number (`PPN`) in `mttp` always read as zeros.

The number of `SDID` bits is `UNSPECIFIED` and may be zero. The number of
implemented `SDID` bits, termed `SDIDLEN`, may be determined by writing one to
every bit position in the `SDID` field, then reading back the value in `mttp`
to see which bit positions in the `SDID` field hold a one. The
least-significant bits of `SDID` are implemented first: that is, if `SDIDLEN` >
0, `SDID`[`SDIDLEN`-1:0] is writable. The maximal value of `SDIDLEN`, termed
`SDIDMAX`, is 8 for `Smmtt34[rw]` or 16 for `Smmtt46[rw]`, `Smmtt56[rw]`.

The `mttp` register is considered active for the purposes of the physical
address protection algorithm unless the effective privilege mode is `M`.

Note that writing `mttp` does not imply any ordering constraints between
`S-mode` and `G-stage` page-table updates and subsequent address translations.
If a supervisor domain's `MTT` structure has been modified, or if a `SDID` is
reused, it may be necessary to execute a `MFENCE.SPA` instruction before or
after writing `mttp`.

=== Machine supervisor domain configuration (`msdcfg`)

The `msdcfg` is a 32-bit read/write register, formatted as shown in <<MSDCFG>>.
This CSR is used by M-mode software to specify the active configuration for
capabilities of the supervisor domain when associated with a hart. +
The following extensions use the `msdcfg` register to specify additional
configuration for supervisor domains:

. `Smsdia` uses `msdcfg.SDICN` to specify the active configuration for
  the supervisor domain interrupt controller associated with the hart.
. `Smsdedbg` specifies the `msdcfg.sdedbgalw` bit to manage
  external-debug for a supervisor domain.
. `Smsdetrc` specifies the `msdcfg.sdetrcalw` bit to manage
  external-trace for a supervisor domain.
. `Smqosid` specifies the control bits `SSM`, `SRL`, `SML` and `SQRID` to enable
  the RDSM to manage QoS controls for supervisor domains.

Details of `Smsdia`, `Smsdedbg`, `Smsdetrc` and `Smqosid` are described in their
respective sections in this specification.

=== M-mode Supervisor Domain Fence Instruction


[caption="Figure {counter:image}: ", reftext="Figure {image}"]
[title="MFENCE.SPA instruction"]

....
{reg: [
  {bits:  7, name: 'opcode (SYSTEM)'},
  {bits:  5, name: 'rd (0)'},
  {bits:  3, name: 'func3 (PRIV)'},
  {bits:  5, name: 'rs1 (PADDR)'},
  {bits:  5, name: 'rs2 (SDID)'},
  {bits:  7, name: 'func7 (MFENCE.SPA)'},
], config:{lanes: 1, hspace:1024}}
....

The `MFENCE.SPA` fence instruction is used to synchronize updates to supervisor
domain access-permissions with current execution.
`MFENCE.SPA` is only valid in M-mode. If operand rs1≠x0, it
specifies a single physical address, and if rs2≠x0, it specifies
a single SDID. Executing a `MFENCE.SPA` guarantees that any previous stores
already visible to the current hart are ordered before all implicit reads by
that hart done for supervisor domain access-permission structures for
non-M-mode instructions that follow the `MFENCE.SPA`.

When SDID is specified in rs2, bits XLEN-1:SDIDMAX held in rs2 are reserved for
future standard use. Until their use is specified, they should be zeroed by
software and ignored by implementations. Also, if SDIDLEN < SDIDMAX, the
implementation shall ignore bits SDIDMAX-1:SDIDLEN of the value held in rs2.

[NOTE]
====
A simpler implementation of MFENCE.SPA may ignore the physical address in rs1,
and/or the SDID value in rs2, and always perform a global fence for all SDs.

=== M-mode Supervisor Domain Fine-Grain Invalidation Instruction

In some high-performance implementations, a finer-granular invalidation and
fencing is required that allows for synchronization operations to be more
efficiently batched. When `Sinval` is implemented with `Smsdid`, the
`MINVAL.SPA` instruction must be implemented to support such fine-granular
invalidation of physical memory access-permission caches.

[caption="Figure {counter:image}: ", reftext="Figure {image}"]
[title="MINVAL.SPA instruction"]
[id=minval-spa]
[wavedrom, ,svg]
....
{reg: [
  {bits:  7, name: 'opcode (SYSTEM)'},
  {bits:  5, name: 'rd (0)'},
  {bits:  3, name: 'func3 (PRIV)'},
  {bits:  5, name: 'rs1 (PADDR)'},
  {bits:  5, name: 'rs2 (SDID)'},
  {bits:  7, name: 'func7 (MINVAL.SPA)'},
], config:{lanes: 1, hspace:1024}}
....

`MINVAL.SPA` is only ordered against `SFENCE.W.INVAL` and `SFENCE.INVAL.IR`
instructions. As part of the update to the SD access-permissions, the RDSM must
ensure that it uses `SFENCE.W.INVAL` to guarantee that any previous stores to
structures that hold supervisor domain access-permissions (e.g. `MTT`) are made
visible before invoking the `MINVAL.SPA`. The RDSM must then use
`SFENCE.INVAL.IR` to guarantee that all subsequent implicit references to
supervisor domain access-permission structures (e.g. `MTT`) are ordered to be
after the SD access-permissions cache invalidation. When executed in order (but
not necessarily consecutively) by a single hart, the sequence `SFENCE.W.INVAL`,
`MINVAL.SPA` and `SFENCE.INVAL.IR` has the same effect as a hypothetical
`MFENCE.SPA` in which:

* the values of rs1 and rs2 for the `MFENCE.SPA` are the same as those used in
the `MINVAL.SPA`,
* reads and writes prior to the `SFENCE.W.INVAL` are considered to be those
prior to the `MINVAL.SPA`, and
* reads and writes following the `SFENCE.INVAL.IR` are considered to be those
subsequent to the `MFENCE.SPA`

`MINVAL.SPA` is only valid in M-mode.
