=== Smmtt[34, 46, 56]rw

The `MTTPPN` rooted structure for the MTT is shown below. The structure
below shows a 56 bit physical address lookup; for lower physical address
widths e.g. 46 bits, the `MTTL3` table is not applicable. In this mode of the
Smmtt[34, 46, 56]rw, each page is associated with a read and a write access
permission (2 bits). <<mtt-map-rw>> shows the Physical address (PA) being
used to index into the `MTT` structure in memory to lookup access
permissions for the supervisor domain specified in the `MTTL1` entry.
Intermediate `MTTL3` and `MTTL2` entries are used to allow this structure to
be sparsely populated.

The following MTT L2/L3 entries accomodate a 56 bit PAW.

{reg: [
  {bits:  44, name: 'MTTL2 PPN'},
  {bits:  20, name: 'ZERO'},
], config:{lanes: 1, hspace:1024}}

  {bits:  4, name: 'TYPE'},
  {bits:  16, name: 'ZERO'},
], config:{lanes: 1, hspace:1024}}
....

The `ZERO` field must always be 0.

The `TYPE` field determines the interpretation of the `MTTL2` entry. The
`TYPE` field encoding is as follows:

* 0000b - `1G_disallow` - read and write access is not allowed for the 1G
range for this supervisor domain
* 0001b - `1G_allow_r` - read access for the 1G range is allowed for the
supervisor domain
* 0011b - `1G_allow_rw` - read and write access for the 1G range is allowed
for the supervisor domain
* 0100b - `MTT_L1_DIR` - The 32M range is composed of 8192x4K pages
* 0111b - `2M_PAGES` - The 32M range is composed of 16x2M pages
* All other encodings are `reserved` and cause an access violation

The `INFO` field depends on the `TYPE` field and is formatted as per the
following table:

.`MTTL2` Entry Type for Smmtt
[width="100%",cols="25%,75%",options="header",]
|===
|*`MTTL2` Entry `TYPE`* |*Description, `INFO` and `TYPE` field encoding*
|`1G_disallow` a|
_The 1G range of address is not allowed for the domain._
The `INFO` field must be 0.
When configuring 1G ranges, RDSM ensures that 32 `MTTL2` entries, each
corresponding to 32M of address space, have identical `TYPE` field values.

|`1G_allow_r` a|
_The 1G range of address is allowed (read only) for the domain._
The `INFO` field must be 0.
When configuring 1G ranges, RDSM ensures that 32 `MTTL2` entries, each
corresponding to 32M of address space, have identical `TYPE` field values.
The INFO field must be 0.

|`1G_allow_rw` a|
_The 1G range of address is allowed (read/write) for the domain._
The `INFO` field must be 0.
When configuring 1G ranges, RDSM ensures that 32 `MTTL2` entries, each
corresponding to 32M of address space, have identical `TYPE` field values.

|`MTT_L1_DIR` a|
The `INFO` field provides the PPN of the `MTTL1` page.
Entries of the `MTTL1` page hold a 4-bit `PERM` (permissions) field to indicate
the access for the supervisor domain (described in the `MTTL1` entry
<<mtt-l1-rw>>).

|`2M_PAGES` a|
_The 32M range of address space is partitioned into 2M pages where each
page has read/write access allowed/not._
The `INFO` field 31:0 holds 2 `PERM` bits per 2M address range to indicate
`access_disallowed` (00b), `read_allowed` (01b), `read_write_allowed` (11b);
(10b is `reserved`). Bits 32:43 are reserved and must be zero.

`MTTL1` table is populated if protection granularity of the 4KiB page is
desired for the supervisor domain.

`MTTL1` entry is indexed using PA[24:12] and each entry is a 4-bit `PERM` field
in the referenced page. The bits 24:16 are used to select a 64-bit field
in the page and bits 15:12 are used to select a 4 bit `PERM` field in those 64
bits. Thus, there are 4 `PERM` bits for each 4 KiB page. The encoding of `PERM`
is as follows:

* 0000b - the 4K page specifies access is *not allowed* for the domain
* 0001b - the 4K page specifies *read* access is allowed for the domain
* 0011b - the 4K page specifies *read* and *write* access is allowed for the
domain
* Remaining encodings are *reserved* and cause an access violation.

=== Smmtt[34, 46, 56]

The MTTPPN rooted structure for the MTT is shown below. The structure
below shows a 56 bit physical address lookup; for lower physical address
widths e.g. 46 bits, the L3 table is not applicable. In this mode of the
SmmttX, each page is associated with an access allowed/disallowed
permission (1 bit) to allow for efficient caching.

], config:{lanes: 1, hspace:1024}}
....

The `ZERO` field must always be 0.

The `TYPE` field determines the interpretation of the `MTTL2` entry. The
`TYPE` field encoding is as follows:

* 00b - `1G_disallow` - access to the 1G range is disallowed
* 01b - `1G_allow` - access to the 1G range is allowed
* 10b - `MTT_L1_DIR` - The 64M range is composed of 16384x4K pages
* 11b - `2M_PAGES` - The 64M range is composed of 32x2M pages

The `INFO` field depends on the `TYPE` field and is formatted as per the table:

.`MTTL2` Entry for Smmtt[34, 46, 56]
[width="100%",cols="25%,75%",options="header",]
|===
|*`MTTL2` Entry Type* |*Description, `INFO` and `TYPE` field encoding*
|`1G_allow` a|
_The 1G range of address is allowed for the domain._
The `INFO` field must be 0.
When configuring 1G ranges, RDSM ensures that 16 `MTTL2` entries, each
corresponding to 64M of address space, have identical `TYPE` field values.

|`1G_disallow` a|
_The 1G range of address is not allowed for the domain._
The `INFO` field must be 0.
When configuring 1G ranges, RDSM ensures that 16 `MTTL2` entries, each
corresponding to 64M of address space, have identical `TYPE` field values.

|`MTT_L1_DIR` a|
The `INFO` field provides the PPN of the `MTTL1` page.
Entries of the `MTTL1` page hold a 2-bit `PERM` field to indicate the access
for the supervisor domain (described in the `MTTL1` entry <<mtt-l1>>).

|`2M_PAGES` a|
_The 64M range of address space is partitioned into 2M pages where each
page has access allowed/not._
The `INFO` field bits 31:0 holds 1 bit per 2M address range to indicate
access disallowed(0b) or allowed (1b). `INFO` field bits 43:32 are
reserved (must be zero).
|===

`MTTL1` table is populated if 4KiB page confidential pages are required
for the supervisor domain.

`MTTL1` entry is indexed using PA[25:12] and each entry is a 2-bit `PERM` field
in the referenced page. The bits 25:16 are used to select a 64-bit field
in the page and bits 16:12 are used to select a 2 bit `PERM` field in those 64
bits. Thus, there are 2 `PERM` bits for each 4 KiB page. The encoding is as
follows:

* 00b - the 4K page specifies access is *not allowed* for the domain
* 01b - the 4K page specifies access is *allowed* for the domain
* 1xb - *reserved* (access causes access violation).

=== Caching

Implementations with virtual memory are permitted to cache translations and
permissions in address translation cache structures. Similarly, access
permissions from the `MTT` lookup may be cached. The `PMP` and `MTT` settings
for the resulting physical address may be checked (and possibly cached) at any
point between the address translation and the explicit memory access. If
caching is occuring, when the `MTT` settings are modified, `M-mode` software
must synchronize the cached `MTT` state with the virtual memory system and any
`PMP`, `MTT` or address-translation caches. This is accomplished by executing
an `SFENCE.VMA` instruction with `rs1=x0` and `rs2=x0`, or `HFENCE.GVMA` as
needed, after the `MTT` is modified. If page-based virtual memory is not
implemented, memory accesses check the `PMP` settings synchronously, but may
check `MTT` settings that are cached, so a `MTT` invalidation (`MTTINVAL`)
instruction is needed. When Svinval is implemented, `MTTINVAL` is only ordered
against `SFENCE.W.INVAL` and `SFENCE.INVAL.IR` instructions. As part of the
`MTT` update, the RDSM must ensure that it uses `SFENCE.W.INVAL` to guarantee
that any previous stores to `MTT` are made visible before invoking the
`MTTINVAL`. The RDSM must then use `SFENCE.INVAL.IR` to guarantee that all
subsequent implicit references to `MTT` are ordered to be after the `MTT` cache
invalidation.

_[TBD - register interface for flushing all MTT cached entries, vs specific
physical address at page size granularity]._
